                                My name is Levi Banks, and I am a computer programmer and a certified data analyst
                                making my way in the world of freelance work. I am an alumnus of University of Portland,
                                where I got a BS in General Studies with a heavy focus on computer science coursework.
                                I also have a BS in Psychology from Portland State University. In terms of positions
                                I have held that are relevant to my current work, I have worked as a marketing
                                assistant,
                                an office coordinator, and as a quality review specialist. Currently, I am doing
                                freelance
                                work for my last employer and for the website DataAnnotation.

                                <br>

                                I mainly do my work using Python, Excel and Power BI, and I am familiar with Java and
                                have used it extensively throughout my academic career. I have experience using Python
                                for web automation using the Selenium library, and I am well-versed at creating ETL
                                processes that get the job done in less time.

                                This website is created using HTML and GitHub pages, and it is my goal to showcase my
                                competency and skillset by creating a landing page for my GitHub that explains what
                                I am capable of.
